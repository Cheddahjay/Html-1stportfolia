    <h3>Jurassic Park</h3>
<p>This was one of my favorite movies as a kid, 
    because I was fascinated at the concept of Dinosaurs. 
    This movie allowed me take a step into the world of imagination and perhaps history of humans. 
    The idea of exisitng among pre-historic animals was such a cool and scary idea.  </p>
    <h3> How to Train a Dragon</h3>
<p>This movie also peaked my interest as a child due to the nature of fasnsy around the ability to tame animals/creatures. 
    The idea of bonding, taming a dragon as a pet was pretty awesome. 
    I liked how each dragon had its own personality. </p>
    <h3>21 Jump Street</h3>
<p>This was one of my favorite movies was i grew up due to the funny nature. 
    There were so manu punchlines and jokes that are still relevent today. 
    This movie brought me alot of laughs. </p>
